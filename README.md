# Cluster Products

Each document is a list of products ordered together in one transaction by a user on an ecommerce platform. These documents are then clustered together to get all items that can be ordered together.

### Use Cases:
1. This can be used to build a co-view based Recommendation System - "People who bought this item, also bought"
2. This can also be used to plan the placement of items in a Warehouse before a sale to enable efficient picking and packing
